a registered student from one of the 3 forms.
This simple registration system interacts with a MySQL database at the back end.

Login Page AND Signup (Home Page)
This is the page that the user first opens. In this page, the user is required to login by entering their username and password. 
The user name and password values are already in a database. After that the user can now register students. If the lecturer isn’t registered, 
there is an option for them to sign up.

Personal Details Form
This page contains a form for the personal details of a student to be entered. The details then get sent to a database table named
‘personal_details’ at the back end when the user clicks on ‘submit’. Then they are directed to the next page for the next form.

Academic Details Form
This page contains a form for the Academic details of a student. The information is sent to a database table named ‘academicdetails’.

the backend named ‘messlodgedetails’

Other Pages for diplaying details of registered student on a table

Validation
All the pages in this website have utilized the php session() function. This means that you cannot access the forms unless you are logged in. 
Also, you cannot access the sign up and sign in page once you are logged in but only once you log out.
JavaScript has also been used for form validation and displaying alert messages to the user if submitting of information through a form is not successful
